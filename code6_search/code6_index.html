ng-app also tells the HTML file that everything written inside the HTML tags is angular code
Please note without knowing that the code written in the tags is angular, HTML cannot process it -->

	This is where we create a searchbox. 
	placeholder="enter username" - is a message dispalyed inside the searchbox, what to input
	required means - if the user leaves the box blank and clicks search then a message is diplayed
	whatever user enters in the searchbox is passed to ng-model. the variable username stores the user input. if I input hridds, then username = hridds

<!--
	Once the user clicks search, the username needs to be passed to the controller
	We do so using a function named search which has a parameter username.
	ng-click = "search(username)" means once the user clicks search, please execute the function search
	which has the username. The control is now tranferred to the function which is defined inside the controller.
