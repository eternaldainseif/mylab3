<!--ng-app is a directive used to name a module. Here the module name is code7.
ng-app also tells the HTML file that everything written inside the HTML tags is angular code
Please note without knowing that the code written in the tags is angular, HTML cannot process it -->

<html ng-app="appName">
<head>
   <!--This script is used to import angular components. This is similar to import statement in JAVA -->
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.4/angular.min.js"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
   
  <!--This is the script file, where we have controller function where data processing is done. 
   We have to include this file so that HTML can use the file -->
  <script src="code7_script.js"></script>
</head>

<!--Here inside the body tag, we call the controller using ng-controller. 
  Main Controller is the name of the controller function written inside the script.js file
  At this point the flow of the program is transffered to the controller function, which is first executed
  and then the output is send back to the HTML file.
  The output is always written inside {{}}. The double curly braces is called moustache, and used to display output in angular 
  Remember the ppt Slide 6, http Response example. info contains the response. 
  To access the name, we have to call info.name 
  Similarly to access other attributes, we have to use: info.attributeName
-->
<body ng-controller="MainController">
  <div> Name: {{info.name}}   </div>

<!--
  This is where we create a searchbox. 
  placeholder="enter username" - is a message dispalyed inside the searchbox, what to input
  required means - if the user leaves the box blank and clicks search then a message is diplayed
  whatever user enters in the searchbox is passed to ng-model. the variable username stores the user input
  if I input hridds, then username = hridds
  Now once the user clicks search, 
-->

<input type="search" required placeholder="name" ng-model ="username"/>
<input type="submit" value="Search" ng-click = "search(username)">


<!--
  Now we have another input, i.e. user selects how to order the output
  So we capture the selection using ngModel and store the value in repoSortOrder
  A drop down menu with 3 options are created.
-->

Order:
<select ng-model="repoSortOrder"> 
<option value= "+name"> Name </option>
<option value= "-stargazers_count"> Stars </option>
<option value= "+language"> Language </option>
</select>

<!--
  We want to display the Name, stars and Language for each repository
  So we create a table, with 3 headers <th> in a single row <tr>
-->

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Stars</th>
    <th> Lang</th>
    </tr>
      </thead>
  
  <!--
  Inside the table body 
  we first use a loop to get one repository at a time 
  Remember repos contains all teh information about repositories. Check Script.js
  We use the orderby to order the repositories based on the the selection made by user
  The selection is stored in ng-model
-->


  <tbody>
    
    <!-- - implies descending sort order >--> 
    <tr ng-repeat ="repo in repos  | orderBy:repoSortOrder">
      <td> {{repo.name}}</td>
   <!--Filter>-->  
     <td> {{repo.stargazers_count | number}}</td>
      <td> {{repo.language}}</td>
    </tr>

</table>
